                        <h2>Predicting Customer Churn</h2>
					</header>
                    <section id="project">
                        <p>As a Fellow at Insight Data Science, I consulted for a startup company,
                            enabling them to predict customer churn in a weekly subscription service.
                            Since I cannot disclose company’s information, the following description is based on a hypothetical scenario,
                            which closely mirrors the company’s business model.
                        </p>
                        <p><i>Imagine a hypothetical company with a new Keurig-like machine, which is equipped with
                            a special function that scans in coffee pod information to brew high-quality, user-tailored coffee.
                            Customers can purchase a selection of these special pods through a weekly subscription service.
                            Because the company’s revenue comes entirely from the subscription service,
                            it is vital to the success of the company to minimize user churn.
                            As a consultant for a real company with a subscription-based service,
                            I was asked to build a churn prediction model in order to identify customers
                            who are on the verge of cancelling their service.</i>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Data</h3>
                        <p>Data consisted of user interactions with the service as well as and survey responses.
                            The most interesting dataset consisted of user activity data,
                            which contained ~3 months worth of timestamps of daily pod usage by each customer. </p>
                        <h3>Feature engineering</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using multiple sources of subscription information,
                                I extracted each user’s <b>subscription history</b> such as cohort number
                                (i.e., when a user started the service), duration of subscription, number of active/skipped weeks.</li>
                            <li>I combined delivery address data with
                                the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ua/urban-rural-2010.html" target="_blank">U.S. census urban/rural classification data</a>
                                to extract each user’s <b>location information (e.g., county and state) and urbanity scores</b>. </li>
                            <li>Most of survey data lacked user ID information.
                                By cross-referencing user names and email addresses,
                                I was able to recover ~45% of user demographics information (e.g., age, gender, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Based on pod usage timestamps, I extracted <b>user engagement metrics</b> for each week.
                                For example, setting a delivery date as a reference point,
                                I estimated time lag between pod usage and delivery,
                                frequency of machine usage,
                                and number of pods that went unused each week (see slide 5).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Predicting customer churn based on long-term user history</h3>
                        <p>To predict customers who are likely to cancel the service,
                            I created a feature matrix with rows representing each user with columns consisting of
                            user subscription history, location information, and average user engagement metrics.
                            Since ~30% of data consisted of churn, I used <a href="https://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf" target="_blank">SMOTE</a>
                            oversampling method to balance the data (note that this technique was applied only to the training data).
                            The resulting balanced feature matrix was then used to train a
                            <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html" target="_blank">random forest classifier</a>.
                            Cross-validation was performed to tune parameters (i.e., number of trees; minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node)
                            based on Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the precision-recall curve.
                            Finally, using a separate test dataset, the model was evaluated (slide 6),
                            which achieved near-optimal performance of 0.94 AUC with 88% recall!</p>
                        <h4>But, is this a <i>good</i> model?</h4>
                        <p>To further evaluate the model, I extracted feature importance (slide 7).
                            The most important features were user history information such as
                            subscription duration, cohort, and number of active weeks.
                            These metrics, however, are rather <i>unique</i> profiles of early adopters,
                            who tend to be more devoted to the product than average users.
                            Therefore, this model may <i>not</i> generalize well if the company’s user base changes over time.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Which <i>actions</i> are indicative of churn?<br>
                            Predicting customer churn based on short-term product engagement</h3>
                        <p>Back to the drawing board, I decided to re-create features focusing on customer actions.
                            Since users are making decisions to either stay or cancel on a weekly basis,
                            I assumed that the the most recent activity leading up to these decisions could reflect a users’ change in mind.
                            Therefore, I segmented two weeks of data in a sliding time window fashion
                            and stacked them up per user and then, across all users,
                            creating a user-agnostic but action-oriented feature set (see slide 8).
                        </p>
                        <p>I then applied a similar approach using SMOTE and random forest classification as described above,
                            which resulted in better than chance AUC of 0.71 and 65% recall (slide 9).
                            Both performance metrics have the potential for improvement as company accumulates more data.
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, I extracted feature importance (slide 10).
                            Interestingly, automatic pods selection in the previous week was the best indicator for churn.
                            That is, the current system sends out a random selection of pods
                            if a user fails to make their own selection by each week’s deadline,
                            which is a strong indicator for user’s decreasing interest in the service.
                            Indeed, when I compared percentage of pods that were selected automatically,
                            churned users had a significantly higher percentage of automatic pods selection than the active users
                            (two-sample <i>t</i>-test, <i>p</i> < 0.001; slide 11).</p>
